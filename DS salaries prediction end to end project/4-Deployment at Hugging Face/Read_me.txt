# To deploy to Hugging Face Spaces:

# 1. Create a Hugging Face account and create a new Space.
# 2. Choose "Gradio" as the app framework.
# 3. Upload this Python code (e.g., `app.py`) to your Space's repository.
# 4. Ensure you have your model file (e.g., `model_salaries.joblib`) in the same repository.
# 5. Set the "requirements.txt" file for the dependencies (gradio, joblib, etc.). 
# 6. Commit your changes and deploy your Space.

# Hugging Face Spaces will automatically set up a web interface for your Gradio app.
