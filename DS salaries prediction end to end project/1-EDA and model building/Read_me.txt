This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling project focused on Data Science Salaries from 2020 to 2024. 

**Key Components:**

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering 
* Regression Model Building (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR)
* Model Evaluation and Selection
* Model Saving

**Objective:**

The primary goal is to understand the factors influencing Data Science salaries and build a model to predict them accurately.

**Dataset:**

The project uses a dataset containing information about Data Science roles, experience level, employment type, company size, location, and salaries.

**Methodology:**

The project follows a systematic approach:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **EDA:** Exploring data patterns and relationships using visualizations and descriptive statistics.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming and creating new features to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Building:** Training and evaluating various regression models to predict salaries.
5. **Model Selection:** Choosing the best-performing model based on accuracy and relevant metrics.
6. **Model Saving:** Saving the selected model for future use and deployment.

**Results:**

The Random Forest Regression model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting data science salaries.

**Future Work:**

Further improvement could involve more advanced feature engineering, integrating external datasets, and building a user-friendly prediction interface.
